# Python-Diverse

![python](assets/python_image.jpg)

This repo is going to be composed of different small projects in Python 3.    

### Python_Modules   
This project is a "piscine" (= series of exercises split in different modules with an increasing difficulty, and new concepts every module and exercise) to explore Python as much as possible.
